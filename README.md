# Sleep-Disorder-prediction-using-Machine-Learning

This project is about building a smart system that can help detect common sleep problems like insomnia and sleep apnea by analyzing health and lifestyle data. Using machine learning, the system looks at factors such as sleep duration, stress, snoring, and physical activity to predict whether a person has a sleep disorder or not.

The main goal is to provide an easy, quick, and affordable way for people to check their sleep health without needing expensive tests or hospital visits. The system has a user-friendly web interface where anyone can enter their sleep-related information and get instant results along with helpful tips to improve their sleep.

Overall, this project aims to make sleep disorder detection accessible to all, raise awareness, and help people take better care of their sleep and well-being.
